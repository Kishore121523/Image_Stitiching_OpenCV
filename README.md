# Image_Stitiching_OpenCV

#Image stitching, or photo stitching, is the process of combining multiple photographic images with overlapping fields of view to produce a segmented panorama or high-resolution image.

Procedure:
-	Input images are saved in a directory. The folder is accessed, and the images are saved in an array.
-	Input images are displayed before stitching.
-	Using the cv2 library and functions, the images are stitched.
-	Once the image has been stitched, post-processing of the stitched image is done using cv2 and imutils python libraries.
